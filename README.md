Real-Time Sign Language Recognition



A real-time sign language recognition system using MediaPipe hand landmarks and an LSTM-based sequence model.



\## Overview

This project captures hand movements via webcam, extracts key landmarks, and predicts sign language gestures in real time.



&nbsp; **Features**

\- Live webcam sign recognition

\- MediaPipe hand landmark extraction

\- LSTM-based temporal modeling

\- Motion-based state detection

\- Hindi text output for recognized signs



\## Motivation

This project was built for a family member who lost the ability to speak due to medical reasons. Rather than being a generic sign language recognition system, it was designed as a personalized communication aid for real-world use.



The goal of this project is to help bridge communication gaps for my family member and, potentially, others facing similar challenges. Future versions will focus on expanding the vocabulary, improving accuracy, and adding voice output to make the system more practical and accessible.



\## Tech Stack

\- Python

\- MediaPipe

\- TensorFlow / Keras

\- OpenCV

\- NumPy



\## Status

This is a working prototype (v1). Accuracy improves with additional training data and refined sign execution.
